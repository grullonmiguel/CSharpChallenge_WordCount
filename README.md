# C# Weekly Challenge - Word Count
Loop through strings and identify total character count

# Goal
Using the starter app, create code that
will loop through the strings and
identify the total character count (count
line returns as 1), the number of
characters excluding whitespace and
line returns, and the number of words in
the string. Finally, list each word,
ensuring it is a valid word.

# Bonus
Identify the unique word list, the most
used word, the unique character list
(just alpha characters), and the most
used character.
